Hi, here is faii's book. 

I am a junior majoring in Cyber Security in Shanghai Jiaotong University. My research interest includes Cyberspace Security, IOT Security, AI Sequrity .etc and I am practicing in NSEC Lab (SJTU) now.

I support communism and want to contribute to it. In daily life, I am addicted to ACG culture such as gal-game and Vtuber. Besides, I enjoy reading literature, philosophy and history classics. "CSLIY" is my plan to learn computer science by myself. Compared with tons of boring and useless tasks, I prefer the "real" growth. 

**'Talk is cheap, show me your code.'**
Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic, and I'm on my way to be a reliable magician.
